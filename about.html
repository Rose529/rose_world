				<div class="col-center-row">
					<p>My interest in the web developer field manifested a few years ago, when i drew out a layout of a website i'd like to create in one of my journals. </p>

				<div class="col-center-row">
					<p>Once i heard of techIMPACT, i took it as an opportunity to gain some knowledge, experience and also to see my thoughts come to life.</p>
					</div>
				<div class="col-center-row">
					<p>At this moment, i'm feeling nervous and intimidated but, also very eager  to go through with the program and see where it can take me.</p>
