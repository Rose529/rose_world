			<p>My name is Roseanny De La Cruz, I am just a young soul from the Bronx, New York who loves to explore.  I am always open to learning new things and bettering myself as a person.  Since young I have always had great interest in technology and how software programs are created.  Now, I am currently enrolled in a web development program named: TechIMPACT, hoping to gain more knowledge and experience; also to get a step closer into the web developer career.</p>
